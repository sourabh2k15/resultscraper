Hola hackers!
I believe in every inch of the *hacker philosophy* and the *open source teachings*. This is a repo I am creating to begin my contribution to the community in a small way. My way of learning is to **learn by doing **, don't sit idle you wanna learn a new language make something , enough of boring exercises, tuts, pdfs and shit !


This is a programming challenge , but way more real than those found on topcoder or hackerearth. Choose your own language , it could be brainf*ck, nodejs or basic ( just an exaggeration , don't take it seriously duh) I will be going with C++ ,as I want to learn C++ .


<h1>Bounty</h1>
If you are a real hacker , you do not need this point , for the fun of completing this task in least code and efficiently is enough for you. For others will have learnt almost all of real concepts of your language in one single fun task ( atleast fun for me ! )
